I'm a (\*cought\* student) back-end developer from France ! 

**About me**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, django and the ropes of full-stack development. Loving it !

- 💼 Looking for work on small websites / apps / APIs. I'm new to this but I'm also a fast learner 💡 Sectors of interest include gaming, politics and sciences !

- 🎲 I'm crazy about roleplaying games ! Yes, D&D, exactly ! It's an amazingly creative hobby, and I'm looking forward to buildings apps for our community ♥️
