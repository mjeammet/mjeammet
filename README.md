- 👋 Hey, I’m Marie !
- 👀 I’m interested in many things but most of all, my high-school sweatheart and long-lasting passion : roleplaying games ! Yes, D&D. Yes, those weird people going on about how heroic their lvl 17 bard gnome was last week against that dragon-minotaur creature ? That's me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django, python and how to become full-stack developer. It's quite a turn from my previous job but it's turning out great, I love it !
- 💞️ Im currently I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, where you'd be okay with my beginnner level and mistakes =) I'm a fast learner, tho and hope to get to BUSINESS soon. Also : if your project has anything to do with role play games apps, especially tabletop or LARP, PLEASE CONTACT ME !
- 📫 You can reach me @ marie.jeammet@protonmail.com
