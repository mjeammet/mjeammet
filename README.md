I'm a web developer from France ! 

**About me**

- 💼 Currently working as a Python web developer @DINUM, hoping to improve public services, with the guidance of my fellow betagouvers. Love it !

- 🎲 I'm crazy about roleplaying games ! Yes, Dungeons & Dragons, exactly ! It's an amazingly creative hobby, and I'm looking forward to building apps for our community ♥️
