<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Marie</h1>

I'm a (\*cought\* student) back-end developer from France ! 

**About me**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, django and how to become a neat full-stack developer. Loving it !

- 💼 Mostly looking for collaborations on small websites / apps / APIs. I'm new to this but I'm also a fast learner 💡

- 🎲 I'm crazy about roleplaying games ! Yes, D&D, exactly ! It's an amazingly creative hobby, and I'm looking forward to buildings apps for our community ♥️
