- 👋 Hey, I’m Marie !
- 👀 My number one long-lasting passion is roleplay ! Yes, D&D. Yes, those geeks going on about how heroic their lvl 17 bard gnome was last week against that dragon-minotaur creature ? That's me. This weirdo getting dressed as a "Rosie" and living a WW2 social revolution for the whole week-end ? That's also me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django, python and how to become a full-stack developer. It's quite a turn from my previous job but it's turning out great, I love it !
- 💞️ Mostly looking to collaborate on small projects, where you'd be okay with my beginnner level and mistakes =) I'm a fast learner though and hope to get to BUSINESS soon. Also : if your project has anything to do with role play games apps, especially tabletop or LARP: I, AM, IN!
